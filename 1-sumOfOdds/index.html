	<h1>Northcoders Entry Challenge</h1>
	<h2>Question 2 - Sum of Odd Numbers</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>In this challenge, you should complete the function sumOfOdds which takes a number n and adds up all the odd numbers up to and including n.</strong></p>

	<p>The scary looking red messsages below are tests for your code that are currently failing. But fear not! You can slowly make all these tests pass by implementing the sumOfOddsx function in the 'main.js' file. All you have to do is write some code in 'main.js', save your changes and refresh this browser tab.</p>
    <p>If you want to test things by logging them to the console you can access the browser console by right clicking on the page, clicking on 'Inspect...' and clicking on the Console tab.</p>
    <p>Take it slow, try to fix one test at a time, read the test description and test your implementation frequently.</p>
